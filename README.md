## Deploy directly from github

TLDR : merge your changes on `main` to trigger the deploy workflow

- Make your changes directly on the `develop` branch 
- Open a pull request, base: `main` compare: `develop`
- Check all your changes, be careful !
- Merge if OK
- Check deployment status here: https://github.com/nemeos/nemeos.github.io/actions
- Potentially need to clear the cache of your navigator to see the change in production
